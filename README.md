# pyCaerMeasure

This repository is a set of utility used to control a complex setup of instruments that is used to carry image sensors characterization.
The utility will require to install libcaer and cAER as well as a gpib usb port that is used to automatically control instruments.

The supported measurements are:

1) Contrast sensitivity
2) Frequency response
3) Latency measurement
4) APS linearity
5) APS Photon Transfer Curve
6) DVS/APS Dynamic Range
7) DVS/APS Gain
8) DVS/APS Fixed Pattern Noise
